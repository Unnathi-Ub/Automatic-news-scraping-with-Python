      "An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France. The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France. In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed. The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings. But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France. Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development. \"There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,\" he said. \"If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.\" The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing. A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with \"we told you so\". Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for \"some tough laws\" and said \"we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country\". Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as \"one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel\". Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025. A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK. More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year. It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.\n",

Tyler Robinson, 22, left a note under a keyboard for his roommate to discover, said Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray. He added that the roommate was the defendant's romantic partner. According to Mr Gray, the note said: \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.\" The prosecutor also shared text messages between the roommates, including one in which the defendant allegedly said he shot Kirk because he had \"had enough of his hatred\".\n",

She confronted the son over the phone about the resemblance, Mr Gray said, but he told her he had been home sick on the day of the shooting. The father later confronted the defendant, who responded by implying he might take his own life, the prosecutor said. The suspect was eventually persuaded to come to his parents' house and while there, allegedly hinted he was the attacker. He then said he wanted to \"end it\" rather than go to jail, Mr Gray said. With the help of a family friend, who is a retired deputy sheriff, his parents convinced him to surrender to police and he was arrested late on Thursday - 33 hours after the shooting. The suspect also allegedly told his parents that \"there is too much evil and the guy spreads too much hate\", in a reference to Kirk, according to the indictment. The mother told investigators her son had become more political in recent years, Mr Gray said, becoming more supportive of gay and transgender rights and entering a relationship with a transgender person. But the prosecutor declined to answer when asked if Kirk had been targeted for his transgender views. \"That is for a jury to decide,\" he said. Mr Gray said the conservative influencer was answering a question about mass shootings carried out by transgender individuals when the gunshot rang out. The bullet struck Kirk in the neck and he immediately slumped to the ground. The shot passed close to other people, including children and the person who asked Kirk the question, said the prosecutor.\n",

He contacted the suspect after the shooting and asked him to send a photo of the rifle, but he did not reply, Mr Gray said. The defendant also detailed his movements after the shooting in messages sent to his roommate. \"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down,\" he wrote, according to prosecutors. \"Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it,\" another message allegedly read. \"I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it.\" The defendant is also charged with witness tampering, prosecutors said, because he directed his partner to delete their messages and stay silent if questioned.\n",

      "Microsoft says its new $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector – its largest outside of the US - should significantly boost Britain's economy in the next few years. The package forms a major part of a £31bn agreement made between the UK government and various other US tech giants, including Nvidia and Google, to invest in British-based infrastructure to support AI technology, largely in the form of data centres. Microsoft will also now be involved in the creation of a powerful new supercomputer in Loughton, Essex. Speaking exclusively to the BBC Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the BBC of the tech's potential impact on economic growth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not ten years but maybe five\". \"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the US-UK deal marked \"a generational step change in our relationship with the US\". He added that the agreement was \"creating highly skilled jobs, putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom.\" The UK economy has remained stubbornly sluggish in recent months. Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s. But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst. Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be over-hyped or under-hyped but also said the newborn tech would still bring about new products, new systems and new infrastructure. He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. He added that investing in data centres was \"effectively\" also investing in modernising the power grid but did not say that money would be shared directly with the UK's power supplier, the National Grid. The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\". The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was already announced by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big tech comes to town\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Nadella, revealed the investment as Donald Trump has arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit. The UK and US have signed a \"Tech Prosperity Deal\" as part of the visit, with an aim of strengthening ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. Google has promised £5bn for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years. Nvidia also pledged to develop AI in the UK, which will help fuel innovation, economic growth and jobs, a spokesperson for the chip giant told the BBC. The company said that along with its partners it will invest up to £11bn in the UK, in what it called the largest AI infrastructure rollout in the country's history. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also opened a £735m data centre as part of the investment on Tuesday in Hertfordshire. There are some concerns that accepting so much money from US investors will mean the UK relies too much on foreign technology. In July, Trump made clear his intentions were for the US to win global the AI race. One of the ways it stated it would do this was to \"export American AI to allies and partners.\" The UK government has signed number of deals with US technology companies, including an agreement to use OpenAI services in the public sector and a £400m contract to use Google Cloud services in the Ministry of Defence. Satya Nadella said he thought the agreement defined \"the next phase of globalisation\" and argued that having access to foreign tech services leveraged digital sovereignty rather than threatened it. On the growing issue of AI taking over jobs, Nadella said Microsoft also had to \"change with the changes in technology\", having laid off thousands of staff this year despite record sales and profits. He described it as \"the hard process of renewal\".\n",

      "When Alan gave his Persian tabby cat, Smokey, its regular flea treatment last year, he thought nothing could go wrong. The 45-year-old from Preston had used the same brand - Frontline Plus - for years without any trouble. But within hours of applying a new dose he'd bought online, his usually lively tabby was violently ill, vomiting and refusing food or water. \"I bought it from a major online site and the price seemed similar so I didn't suspect anything at the time,\" Alan told the BBC's Morning Live. Alan's story comes after the government recently issued an urgent warning about fake veterinary products being sold online. With vet bills up 60% in the last decade, more owners are turning to the internet to hunt for bargains. Watch Alan and Smokey's story on Morning Live\n",

      "The vet that Alan took Smokey to initially found nothing abnormal, but when his condition deteriorated, scans revealed a blockage in his intestines. Emergency surgery saved his life - at a cost of £3,000 - and tests later confirmed he had suffered a toxic reaction. Alan returned to the vet with the packaging. At first glance, it looked genuine, labelled as \"Gatti\" - which Alan assumed might be an Italian version of the medication. But when the manufacturer was contacted, they confirmed it was counterfeit and laboratory testing found it contained a chemical highly toxic to cats. \"We felt really guilty about the fact we had done this to him,\" Alan said. \"But finding out it was fake medication, we were really angry. \"It's horrific and I had absolutely no idea there was such a thing as fake pet medication.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Barnham works at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), a government team tasked with trying to stop the sale of counterfeit goods. The team has issued more than 100 seizure notices for the selling of unauthorised animal medicines and supplements, preventing around 18,000 illegal items from reaching consumers. \"Criminals copy these products to make them look like the original and it's all to make money, they don't care about the damage or harm,\" she explained. According to the IPO, the online seller who Alan bought the medication from managed to sell 211 batches of suspected counterfeit pet medications and supplements. \"If it's not from a vet or a trusted seller then please be vigilant,\" Barnham said. Barnham is urging pet owners to check all pet medicines carefully before using them. Even if a product looks authentic, there are often subtle clues something is wrong.\n",

      "Robert Redford, who has died at the age of 89, appeared in more than 50 Hollywood films, won an Oscar as a director, and became a champion of independent film-makers, founding the annual Sundance Film Festival to showcase their work. Success meant he could pick and choose his projects, with many chiming with his politically liberal views. And he campaigned on environmental issues and for the rights of Native Americans. His all-American good looks couldn't be ignored: Redford was once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\". Another critic said he had \"a fluid physical grace and an inner radiance that sometimes makes it seem as if he's lit from within\". But overall, Redford thought his beauty was more of a hindrance than a help to his career - and said karma had brought tragedy in his family life to punish him for his physical good fortune. Film world pays tributes to Robert Redford\n",

      "Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, on 18 August 1936 - the son of a milkman who later became an accountant with Standard Oil. At school, he became part of a street gang and was arrested for \"borrowing an automobile that had stolen jewellery in its trunk\". He won a scholarship to the University of Colorado thanks to his prowess at baseball, but was thrown out after 18 months for drunkenness. At the same time, his mother died - aged just 40. Stricken with grief, he drifted for a while, finding work in the Californian oilfields - before travelling to Paris and Florence, where he studied art. His sojourn in Europe encouraged him to take a fresh approach to the United States: \"I began to look at my country from another point of view,\" he later said. Returning home, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Art with ambitions to become a theatrical designer - but quickly switched to acting. Like many actors in late 1950s New York, he picked up a number of small roles on stage and television, including parts in popular series such as The Untouchables, Perry Mason and Dr Kildare.\n",

      "Getty Images The 1965 film Inside Daisy Clover, opposite Natalie Wood, was a breakthrough for Redford\n",
      "\n",
      "His big-screen debut came in 1960 with a minor role in Tall Story, where he found himself working alongside Jane Fonda. It was not an auspicious start to his film career. The film flopped - with Time magazine opining that \"nothing can save this picture\". However, it did mark the beginning of a lifetime's friendship with Fonda, who later admitted to falling in love with him each time they worked together.\n",

      "\"There was always a mystery because he didn't reveal anything. He's got an aura about him,\" she said. His first major stage success was as pompous lawyer Paul Bratter in Neil Simon's romantic comedy Barefoot in the Park. It was a role he would reprise in the 1967 film version, opposite Fonda. In 1965, he picked up a Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer for his role in the film Inside Daisy Clover with Natalie Wood. But he was turned down for the part of Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate because director Mike Nichols felt he was too good-looking - which made Redford wary of being stereotyped by his appearance.\n",

      "Global fame came in 1969 with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The 33-year-old's portrayal of the laidback Kid, in contrast to Paul Newman's fast-talking Butch, proved to be one of Hollywood's great partnerships. Ironically, Redford nearly missed out on the part after one studio executive said: \"He's just another Hollywood blond. Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you'll hit six like him.\" The studio did everything it could to avoid hiring Redford, until Newman - a huge established star - stepped in and insisted. The two actors found they shared a love of theatre, and remained firm friends until Newman's death in 2008.\n",

      "\"We'd play tricks on each other,\" Redford said of his relationship with Newman. \"The more sophisticated the joke the better.\" In 1973, their natural on-screen chemistry saw them team up again in The Sting. Redford was Oscar-nominated for his role as Johnny Hooker, a small-time grifter who joins forces with Newman's character to swindle a vicious crime boss. The film, with its distinctive ragtime soundtrack, eventually won seven Academy Awards including best picture - although Redford was beaten to the best actor award by Jack Lemmon. It was the only time Redford was ever nominated in the best actor category at the Oscars, although he would later win as a director - and received an honorary Oscar in 2002.\n",

      "Redford's acting roles were prolific throughout the 70s, although there were mixed reviews for his turn as the enigmatic Gatsby in The Great Gatsby, and he was overshadowed by Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were. But in 1974, Redford bought the film rights to All the President's Men, an account of the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - the two Washington Post reporters who uncovered it. \"The Washington Post were very nervous about us - that this was Hollywood and it could hurt them,\" he recalled. Released in 1976, with Redford playing Woodward alongside Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, the film was a critical success, winning four Oscars - including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Jason Robards. Four years on, and Redford made his directorial debut with 1980's Ordinary People, a study of the collapse of a middle-class family after the death of one of their sons. It won him his first and only Oscar.\n",

      "With recognition came wealth. Redford used much of his earnings to buy a ski resort in Utah, his wife Lola's home state, which he renamed Sundance after one of his most famous roles. Around the same time, he founded the Sundance Institute to provide creative and financial support to independent film-makers. He went on to become chairman of the Utah/US Film Festival, later renamed the Sundance Film Festival. Over time, the festival became a key event in the film calendar, showcasing the work of many directors who went on to become household names, including Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. In acting terms, there were hits and misses over the last two decades of the 20th Century. Prison drama Brubaker was a commercial and critical success, and there was a positive reception for popular dramas The Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal. Out of Africa won a fistful of awards, but Havana was badly received and lost money at the box office. Simultaneously, Redford continued to direct, including A River Runs Through It - which gave a career boost to a fledgling Brad Pitt - and The Legend of Bagger Vance, the last film to feature Jack Lemmon.\n",

      "There was a muted reception for Lions for Lambs, which saw him reunited with Out of Africa's Meryl Streep. There was high praise, however, for his role in the groundbreaking All is Lost - about an elderly yachtsman alone on his damaged boat in the Indian Ocean. \"There's no dialogue, none at all. And I'm the only actor on screen in the whole movie,\" Redford said. Many critics described his performance as the best of his career. He also starred as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Alexander Pierce in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film far removed from his usual fare. \"I like the idea of stepping into new territory,\" he told the LA Times, in 2013. \"This is the kind of film I would love to have seen as a kid.\" Away from the studio, Redford became a prominent advocate for the environment. \"Ours is a sick planet because of our behaviour on it,\" he said in a 2014 interview.\n",

      "Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, and the couple had four children. Their youngest, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome aged two months. In interviews, Redford said he believed that karma had punished him for possessing sexual magnetism and leading the hedonistic life of an actor. \"It felt like retribution,\" he says. \"I always had this thing that death was on my shoulder, 24/7. My dogs, as a kid. My mum. My firstborn.\" The couple divorced in 1985, and Redford had lengthy romances with Brazilian actress Sonia Braga and costume assistant Kathy O'Rear. He married Sibylle Szaggars - a German-born artist - in 2009. In 2020, his son, David, died in his fifties from complications of bile duct cancer. He had been ill since birth and had had two liver transplants. In 2019, Redford announced his retirement from acting soon after his cameo in Avengers: Endgame. But he found it hard to leave the limelight. Approaching the age of 90, he reversed his decision a few years later - to appear in several episodes of Dark Winds, the story of two Navajo police officers who try to solve a double murder.\n",

      "Getty Images The number of people taking their driving test in an automatic car is rising every year\n",
      "\n",
      "One in four driving tests in Great Britain are being taken in automatic cars, according to new data, as drivers opt for more electric vehicles (EVs) and shy away from manual gearboxes. Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) show that 470,000 of the 1.8 million driving tests taken in England, Scotland, and Wales last year were done in automatics. Insurer AA said the trend is being driven by the UK's ban on new the sale of new petrol and diesel cars coming in 2030, as EVs do not need manual gearboxes. Emma Bush, the managing director of AA's driving school, said the need to know how to drive a manual car is becoming \"irrelevant to many\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To obtain a full driving licence for Great Britain a driver must pass their test in a car with manual gears. If the test is taken in an automatic car, the driver would get a Category B Auto licence, restricting them to driving to vehicles with automatic transmission only. Northern Ireland issues its own driving licences. Ms Bush said that drivers and learners are \"becoming confident with the idea of their driving future being electric\". \"As we head closer to 2030 and the ban on the sale of new combustion cars, more and more learners will want to learn in an electric vehicle as that's all they will plan to drive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the general election last year, the Labour government pledged to restore the petrol and diesel ban to 2030, after previous prime minister Rishi Sunak pushed it back to 2035. The lower day-to-day running costs of EVs and hybrids is also attractive to many, Ms Bush said. EVs can be significantly more expensive than a petrol or diesel car or a hybrid upfront, but the gap is narrowing. Additionally, EV owners can expect to save money on fuel and maintenance costs. Sue Howe, the owner of Sue's Driving School in Swindon, told the BBC that automatics are \"the way forward\" as the car industry moves towards EVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue Howe Driving instructor Sue Howe says automatics are the way forward\n",
      "\n",
      "For learner drivers, Ms Howe said, automatics can make the test easier, as \"there's just a lot less to do\". Inexperienced drivers can \"wreck a gearbox and a clutch\", Ms Howe said, adding that nerves may cause them to stall or cut out the engine. She also said the trend was good for road safety as \"people are less tired\" driving an automatic. \"It just makes life so much easier - it's less work for the driver to do so they can concentrate more time on the road.\"\n",

Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley were travelling in a parliamentary delegation to see medical and humanitarian work being carried out by organisations including Medical Aid for Palestinians. In a joint statement the two MPs said it was \"deeply regrettable\" that Israeli authorities had \"prevented them from seeing first-hand the grave challenges facing medical facilities in the region\". The Israeli Embassy in London have been approached for comment.\n",

      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \"It is totally unacceptable and deeply concerning that yet again two British MPs have been denied entry to the occupied Palestinian territories by Israel. \"Minister [Hamish] Falconer and officials have remained in contact with the MPs affected throughout. We are clear with Israel that this is no way to treat British Parliamentarians.\" The two MPs were crossing into Israel from Jordan on Monday on a three-day visit organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) when they were stopped by Israeli authorities. Opher told the BBC they were held in a passport office before being handed a \"legal form insisting that we leave the country\" and then \"escorted to a bus\" back to Jordan. The Stroud MP said he was told they were not being admitted on \"public order\" grounds and that representations from the Foreign Office to Israeli authorities had been rejected. He said: \"It's very disappointing. We are both doctors and we were really just going to look at healthcare facilities in the West Bank to see if there was anything we could do to support them.\" \"We weren't in any way trying to undermine the Israelis, just trying to see what we could do in the West Bank\" where, he said, they had been told healthcare was getting increasingly difficult. They had also been due to meet the British Consul General in Jerusalem as part of the visit, as well as meeting Palestinian and Israeli human rights organisations. Both Prinsley, who represents Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, and Opher were first elected to Parliament in 2024.\n",

      "In central London, on land the size of seven football pitches, sits a mansion called Winfield House - the official residence of the US ambassador to the UK. It may be a stately home but through the years it's been known to throw one hell of a party, especially on 4 July, America's Independence Day. This year's celebration saw Nile Rodgers & Chic headline the building's lawn for thousands of people. Fashion's elite, sports stars and wartime leaders have all been entertained here. Even in 1825 when the original site was built, according to Winfield's official website, its primary use was for entertainment. President Donald Trump is spending the first night of his state visit at the 35-room mansion. The Trumps also stayed there in 2019, as did the Bidens and Obamas previously. \"It's not just the home of the ambassador, but it's also a centre of diplomatic hospitality,\" says Stephen Crisp, formerly the property's head gardener, who worked there for 37 years until his retirement last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing Winfield isn't, is a tourist attraction. Located inside Regent's Park, it's exclusive and takes planning to get inside. Friends of Regent's Park previously arranged tours of the grounds - but so far this year the ambassador has not granted permission. From the road outside, the house cannot be seen. It's shrouded in woodland and is very private for central London. \"It's really, really difficult to get in there. I regard it as a feather in my cap that I actually managed to get in,\" says Viv Ward, Friends of Regent's Park's event manager. He calls the house \"magnificent\" and is audibly in awe of the grounds. Tours of Winfield only allow you to see the ground floor, which is basically a \"very posh\" area for receptions, and the gardens. The first floor is home to the personal apartments of the ambassador. As a home and the venue of most American receptions, schedules are tight. \"It wasn't a case of we would like to come on this date and this time. It was just, you will be allowed to come here on this day,\" Mr Ward says. The property boasts the second-largest private garden in central London, says Mr Crisp. It's home to a lawn, paved walkways, sculptures - and there's also space for helicopters to land.\n",

      "Socialite and heir to the Woolworths fortune Barbara Hutton sold Winfield to the US government for a mere dollar in 1946 in an offer described by the then-president Harry S Truman as \"most generous and patriotic\". Hutton had bought the house 10 years earlier after it was partly destroyed in a fire. The Crown Estate Commission gave her permission to tear it down and rebuild in the iconic red brick Georgian style that remains today. She named it after her grandfather, Frank Winfield Woolworth, the founder of the Woolworth shopping chain. With World War Two about to erupt and her second marriage not going particularly well, Hutton returned to America with her son in 1939. It would later be revealed this is when she met her next husband - actor Cary Grant - who is said to have stayed at the mansion with her.\n",

Hutton returned to London to see what was left of it at the end of the war - and after the Germans' bombs. She called her lawyer and requested it be handed over to the US government for repairs - and it's been used as the official residence of ambassadors ever since. History is in the walls of Winfield. The original building was called St Dunstan's, and according to Friends of Regent's Park, was used for blind veterans of World War One. A charity of the same name still exists today. Speaking about US presidents, Mr Crisp says: \"At some point they all come, at least once.\" He explains he met Trump and his wife Melania during their previous state visit in 2019, which was \"a little bit surreal\". They dined at the property with Queen Camilla and King Charles III before he ascended to the throne. An iconic image of Mikhail Gorbachev - the last Soviet leader - and US President George HW Bush may be one of the most famous moments from the house. The pair held a joint news conference there at the G7 summit in 1991. Politicians have long used it for key moments, including international summits, grand state dinners and bringing together wartime leaders.\n",

As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, governments use the visits to further Britain's interests. Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush. However, in February Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles III during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Sir Keir said the invite was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\". Trump said it was a \"great, great honour\". Trump loves all things royal. Will that be the King's ace card?\n",

      "Josh Wintersgill has been running a successful business selling products to help wheelchair users travel for six years, but its future hangs in the balance. He's been using the government's Access to Work scheme to help with some of the additional costs of running his company and is afraid that he may lose it after his one-on-one support was slashed by 80%. The Business Disability Forum (BDF) says businesses and their disabled employees are being \"set up to fail,\" despite the government's ambitions to get 80% of disabled people into the workforce. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it was reviewing all aspects of the scheme.\n",

      "\n",
      "Josh needs physical support with most things throughout the day because of his disability. This includes travelling, overnight stays and packing and shipping customer orders. Without this support he says he would not be able to run his company. The Access to Work grant was providing him with a support worker five days a week, but on reassessment, it was reduced to one day. He said: \"They're basically with me all the time. They help me in every facet of helping me do my job and without them, I can't do any of that.\" Josh has appealed the decision and has not had any support since the start of July, when his grant ran out, despite no change in his personal circumstances. Under the Access to Work scheme, companies and employees can apply for grants to help support disabled people in the workplace. The programme can pay employees and businesses for the extra costs associated with being a disabled worker - things that go beyond what is legally required by employers to provide. It covers a range of things like paying for taxis, assistive technology and British Sign Language interpreters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disabled people have told the BBC their awards have been significantly reduced, completely taken away and in some cases left them forced to shut their businesses and turn down job offers. Josh is currently managing by using his own money to keep the business afloat, but says things are \"very tight\" and he'll only be able to do this for the next few months. \"I'm not getting everything done that I used to get done,\" he says. \"There's so much to do that it's just so hard to stay on top of it... it's just really frustrating.\" Josh says Access to Work helped him get into work and set up his own business, but is fearful of what will happen if that is taken away. \"It's scary to think that I'm a disabled entrepreneur, helping disabled people and potentially being deprived of doing that.\" Jobs fears as disability scheme owes businesses thousands\n",

In between customers she explains how working at the cafe has given her confidence and a sense of pride and now trains others on how to work with neurodiverse and disabled staff. Lexie's reapplication took 10 months to come through and when it did the hours for her one-to-one support worker had been greatly reduced, leaving the business to make up the shortfall. \"A lot of employers in that time physically would not be able to manage keeping people like myself employed,\" she said. Lexie says she sees a lot of her colleagues worry about their job prospects because of the problems with Access to Work.

A government consultation on Access to Work closed at the end of June with ministers currently reviewing what a new scheme could look like. ​​Angela Matthews, director of public policy and research at BDF called on the government to make access to work \"more efficient and more resourced\". ​​She told the BBC: \"Disabled people are set up to fail and so are employers, because disabled people won't get what they need to be able to work and employers won't have the means or the support to provide an inclusive workplace for disabled people.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Nepal's Gen Z protesters brought down a government in under 48 hours – but the victory has come at a heavy price. \"We are proud, but there is also a mixed baggage of trauma, regret and anger,\" says Tanuja Pandey, one of the protest organisers. With 72 people killed, last week's protests were the deadliest unrest in the Himalayan country in decades. Official buildings, residences of political leaders and luxury hotels such as the Hilton, which opened in July 2024, were torched, vandalised and looted. The wife of a former prime minister is fighting for her life after their home was set ablaze. The protests represented \"a wholesale rejection of Nepal's current political class for decades of poor governance and exploitation of state resources\", said Ashish Pradhan, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. But the damage to government services, he added, could \"parallel the toll of the 2015 earthquake which took almost 9,000 lives\". The destruction is not only confined to the capital Kathmandu - at least 300 local government offices across the nation have been damaged. The financial losses could amount to 3 trillion Nepalese rupees ($21.3bn; £15.6bn), nearly half of the country's GDP, according to the Kathmandu Post. Its offices were also attacked by crowds and set on fire.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Nepo babies'\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days before the deadly demonstration on 8 September, Ms Pandey, a 24-year-old environmental campaigner, uploaded a video showing a mining site in Chure, one of the most fragile mountain ranges in the region. Nepal's resources should belong to the people, not to \"politicians' private limited companies\", she wrote, calling on her peers to \"march against corruption and the misuse of our nation's wealth\". Like many youth movements in Asia, Nepal's Gen Z protests were leaderless. Others had made similar pleas to Ms Pandey's after the Nepali government decided to ban 26 social media platforms, citing their failure to register locally. For months, fury had been brewing against \"nepo babies\", the children of powerful politicians of all stripes, who were accused of flaunting their unexplained wealth on social media. One of the most viral photos showed Saugat Thapa, the son of a provincial minister, standing next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. In response, he said it was \"an unfair misinterpretation\" and his father \"returned every rupee earned from public service to the community\". Ms Pandey had watched almost all \"nepo babies\" content, but one video juxtaposing the luxurious life of a political family and an ordinary young Nepali who had to find work in a Gulf country struck her. \"It is painful to watch, especially knowing that even educated youth are forced to leave the country because wages here are far below what one needs to live with dignity,\" she said. Nepal is a young democracy. It became a republic in 2008, after a decade-long, Maoist-led civil war that killed more than 17,000 people. But the promised stability and prosperity have not materialised. In 17 years, Nepal has had 14 governments, and no leader has completed a full five-year term. The country's politics resemble a game of musical chairs, with communist parties and the centrist Nepali Congress taking turns to rule. Three leaders, including KP Sharma Oli who resigned over the Gen Z protests, returned to power multiple times. Nepal's GDP per capita remained under $1,500, making it the second-poorest country in South Asia, behind only Afghanistan. An estimated 14% of the population work overseas, and one in three households receives remittances. Ms Pandey comes from a middle-class family in eastern Nepal and her father is a retired government teacher. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which she is still receiving treatment. The medical bills nearly bankrupted her family, so her older sister moved to Australia to support them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the protests, Ms Pandey worked with others to create guidelines stressing non-violence and respect and reminding participants to stay vigilant against \"hijackers\". On the morning of 8 September, she arrived at Maitighar Mandala, a huge traffic island in central Kathmandu with several of her friends. She was expecting thousands would turn up at most – but the crowds kept swelling. Aakriti Ghimire, a 26-year-old protester, said things were initially peaceful and communal. \"We were all seated, we were singing old Nepali songs,\" she said. \"The slogans and everything were so funny, we were enjoying it. And after that, we started to march… the police were there to ensure that there were no vehicles disturbing us.\" Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire started to sense danger at around midday, when crowds began moving to New Baneshwor, the neighbourhood housing parliament. Both saw people arriving on motorbikes, and Ms Pandey said these people appeared older than average Gen Z protesters. Ms Ghimire believes they were infiltrators. \"It became very tricky for us to distinguish the peaceful protesters – some people who genuinely came for something – versus those who came in with the intention of being violent.\" When some protesters tried to breach the security around parliament, police fired tear gas, water cannon and shots in return. There is evidence live rounds were used and they are accused of shooting at schoolchildren as well. An investigation into what happened is under way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters The Hilton was one of the targets of arsonist attacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Chaos and violence reigned the next day. Demonstrators retaliated by setting parliament, the prime minister's office and other government buildings ablaze. Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire stayed indoors and watched the developments online. \"A lot of people did share that it felt so good to finally see politicians face the consequences of everything they've done,\" Ms Ghimire said, referring to the destruction of the leaders' homes. But the mood soon darkened. \"I saw people with bottles filled with petroleum. They got it from the motorbikes. They started attacking the parliament,\" said Ms Pandey. The law graduate cried after seeing the Supreme Court on fire, saying that it was like \"a temple\" for her. Her friends at the scene were pouring water on the flames to try to put them out. They all knew the effort would be futile – they did it only to console themselves. \"People say the arsonists intended to come and burn these things… Who are these people?\" asked Ms Ghimire. \"The videos show these people are all masked.\" Some calm was restored when the army was deployed to take control of the situation - a curfew was in place for days. Later in the week former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister. She had been backed by protesters for the post. Ms Pandey hopes she \"can lead the country efficiently, do the election in stipulated time and hand the power to the people\". But the anxiety about Nepal's political future persists. Rumela Sen, a South Asia expert at Columbia University, said it was \"worrying\" to see \"an unprecedented glorification of the army as a voice of sanity and stability\". Many are also uncomfortable with the involvement of Durga Prasai in the initial negotiation at the invitation of the military. Mr Prasai was arrested for his role in violent pro-monarchy protests in March. He fled to India but was returned to Nepal. The Gen Z protesters walked out.\n",

      "The wheat fields outside Seqalbia, near the Syrian city of Hama, should be golden and heavy with grain. Instead, Maher Haddad's 40 dunums (10 acres) are dry and empty, barely yielding a third of their usual harvest. \"This year was disastrous due to drought,\" said the 46-year-old farmer, reflecting on the land that cost him more to sow than it gave back. His fields delivered only 190kg (418 lbs) of wheat per dunum - far below the 400-500kg he relies on in a normal year. \"We haven't recovered what we spent on agriculture; we've lost money. I can't finance next year and I can't cover the cost of food and drink,\" Mr Haddad told the BBC. With two teenage daughters to feed, he is now borrowing money from relatives to survive. Mr Haddad's struggle is echoed across Syria, where the worst drought in 36 years has slashed wheat harvests by 40% and is pushing a country - where nearly 90% of the population already lives in poverty - to the brink of a wider food crisis. A report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates Syria will face a wheat shortfall of 2.73m tonnes this year, the equivalent of annual dietary needs for 16.25 million people.\n",

      "Without more food aid or the ability to import wheat, Syria's hunger crisis is set to worsen dramatically, warned Piro Tomaso Perri, FAO's senior programme officer for Syria. \"Food insecurity could reach unprecedented levels by late 2025 into mid-2026,\" he said, noting that more than 14 million Syrians - six in 10 people - are already struggling to eat enough. Of those, 9.1 million face acute hunger, including 1.3 million in severe conditions, while 5.5 million risk sliding into crisis without urgent intervention. The same report showed rainfall has dropped by nearly 70%, crippling 75% of Syria's rain-fed farmland. \"This is the difference between families being able to stay in their communities or being forced to migrate,\" Mr Perri said. \"For urban households, it means rising bread prices. For rural families, it means the collapse of their livelihoods.\" Farming families are already selling livestock to supplement lost incomes from wheat, reducing their number of daily meals, and there has been a rise in malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women. Yet, the implications of the drought stretch far beyond the thousands of kilometres of barren farmlands. Wheat is a staple crop in Syria. It is the main ingredient for bread and pasta - two food staples that should be low cost foods to families. So with the lack of wheat supply, the cost goes up. For 39-year-old widow Sanaa Mahamid, affording bread has become a massive struggle. With six children between the ages of nine and 20, she relies on the wages of two sons, but their salaries are not enough to cover the family's basic expenses. \"Sometimes we borrow money just to buy bread,\" she said.\n",

      "Matt Precey/BBC Dan Cooper has decided to waive his anonymity to encourage others to go to the police\n",
      "\n",
      "It was while serving on a jury in 2018 that Dan Cooper said he had realised he needed to pursue justice for himself after being raped in 2004. \"When I heard the people giving evidence, I could literally see myself in the same situation,\" Dan said after waiving his right to anonymity to share his story. After the trial, the now 39-year-old from Watton, Norfolk, decided to go to Norfolk Police again and report his attacker. On 27 February 2024, 20 years after the attack took place, Shaun Gilder, from Oulton Broad, Suffolk, was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of two counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dan was 17 when he met 21-year-old Shaun Gilder in Norwich in 2004 and their encounter developed into his first relationship. On a Saturday evening in May that year, the couple had been to a barbecue when Gilder got drunk and asked Dan to drive him home. At about midnight Gilder told Dan to stop the car on a quiet road behind the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk. Gilder attacked Dan and left him with serious internal injuries which led him to being admitted to hospital three times that summer. Traumatised, Dan was somehow able to drive Gilder home before returning to his mum's house. \"I lay in bed for hours thinking, 'what has just happened? what had just gone on?',\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Norfolk Police Shaun Gilder was sentenced to eight years almost two decades after he carried out the rape\n",
      "\n",
      "The following September, Dan went to the police and reported the attack. Dan said he had provided a statement at the time, but it did not proceed any further because he was \"extremely unwell at that point\". His grandparents and other family members did not know he was gay, he added. \"Life was different back then,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan is now project manager for the civil service but he previously worked in a prison, where he said he would find himself holding back tears when inmates discussed their own abuse. He added he was assaulted on the job, which also led to flashbacks. \"Then the jury service. Flashbacks back to the rape again. It was a non-stop cycle that needed to stop,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The female witnesses who helped secure a conviction in the 2018 trial in which he was a jury member were \"inspirational\", according to Dan. \"It was just remarkable to see them going up and giving evidence and dealing with the difficult questions being thrown their way,\" he said. \"I was working at Stansted Airport as an immigration officer at this time and I had to take three weeks off sick. \"It was then that I re-reported [the attack] to the police and I asked them to take it forward for me, which they said they could do,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphic evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "Two Norfolk Police detectives were assigned to Dan's case in 2018 and it proceeded to a charge and trial at Norwich Crown Court in November 2023. In his victim impact statement, Dan described how he had been diagnosed with complex post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) linked to the rape. \"I have had, and still have, regular thoughts of suicide,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quarter of adult women and about 6% of adult men have been the victims of sexual assault, or attempted sexual assault, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. A 2024 study by Manchester Metropolitan University found 44% of 180 people who were exposed to graphic evidence in court reported symptoms consistent with PTSD. \"Past trauma experiences, mental health difficulties and immediate stress responses during a trial can exacerbate emotional and stress reactions,\" the researchers wrote.\n",

      "\n",
      "Back in 2004, Dan's mother, Nicki Duffield, confronted Gilder when he came to see her son in hospital after Dan had told her what had happened. \"There was a rage like a fire burning inside me. I was so angry,\" she recalled. Gilder left and it was the last time she saw him. When speaking to her son, she said: \"I felt so proud of you for sticking by what you believed in and taking it all the way through. It was justice for you. You'd worked so hard. \"Mentally it had really taken a toll on you and we could see how you struggled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan said his current work as an on-call firefighter for Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service had helped him with the healing process. \"Doing this for the community has given me something to focus on and live for,\" he said.\n",

      "Dan said he now enjoyed caring for his three dogs, mountain bikes and travelling. Since May he has started to make videos about his experience and posts them on social media, where he now has 12,000 followers on TikTok. \"It's helped a lot of people.

      "BBC Patricia Ogunfeibo has rented out properties since 1986\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would really like to come out of being a landlord,\" says Patricia Ogunfeibo. The 61-year-old has just sold a two-bedroom flat in south-east London, one of her nine properties. She is one of many landlords selling their properties ahead of the new Renters' Rights Bill - one of the biggest overhauls of the private rental sector. Once the bill becomes law, the government will ban Section 21 \"no-fault\" evictions, give tenants greater rights to challenge rent increases and make it illegal to discriminate against prospective tenants on benefits. Ms Ogunfeibo says \"landlords are scared\" of some of the changes due to come into effect. The government says the bill will provide tenants with \"greater security, rights and protections in their homes\". The proposed changes have been widely welcomed by renters including Natasha Johnson, who was evicted through the Section 21 clause in 2020 and says it was \"traumatic\".\n",
      "\n",

      "Ms Ogunfeibo is selling a two-bedroom flat in south-east London ahead of the Renters' Rights Bill\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Ogunfeibo, who has rented out properties since 1986, says by selling the flat she was \"able to get out the money\" she had put into it. She says she accepts that parts of the law are needed, including a Private Rented Sector Database to help landlords understand their legal obligations and demonstrate compliance. But she is concerned that the bill will ultimately push rents up. \"We need more affordable homes in the UK at the moment,\" she says. \"What we don't need is the private rental sector being contracted because landlords are scared and they're selling up and they're leaving the sector.\" This time last year the Property Franchise Group, which is behind brands including Hunters, Fine & Country and EweMove, was managing 153,000 rental homes for landlords, but that has fallen to 150,000 at the last count. Meanwhile, data from real estate agency Knight Frank showed the number of new lettings properties coming to the London market in the year to August was 8% below the previous 12-month period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whilst landlords will take into account many factors when deciding future investment plans, including tax and energy efficiency policies, the bill will play a major part for many in deciding their futures\" says Chris Norris, chief policy officer for the National Residential Landlords Association. \"Given this, amidst a lack of rental housing to meet demand, it's vital that the bill has the confidence of responsible landlords every bit as much as tenants.\" He said it was key that courts had the capacity to process legitimate possession cases swiftly when Section 21 ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a survey of 821 landlords in May 2021 by the flat rental website SpareRoom, small landlords are more likely to exit the market than professional landlords. According to the data, four in 10 UK landlords with one to two rental properties say they plan to leave the market compared with 22% of those with five to nine properties and 26% of those with more than 10 properties. But according to SpareRoom, so far, supply in the room rental market remains largely unaffected by the Renters' Rights Bill with January 2025 the highest month for flatshare ads in four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natasha Johnson was evicted through Section 21 in 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "The Renters' Rights Bill will introduce a new system giving new tenants a 12-month \"protected period\" where they cannot be evicted if the landlord wants to move in or sell the property. Landlords can still get rid of tenants for other reasons including criminal behaviour by the tenants. After the first year, landlords would have to give tenants four months' notice to leave, doubling the current time period, and provide a specific reason for ending a tenancy. The move is \"welcome news\" for Ms Johnson, who was evicted with her teenage son from their rental property in 2020 in the middle of the Covid pandemic. She now campaigns for others in a similar situation through the London Renters Union (LRU). \"No-one should be able to go through that,\" she said. \"We're human beings. Some form of communication, compromise. It was really really traumatic. I wouldn't wish that on my own enemies.\" She said she and her teenage son moved from shelter to shelter, and even spent one night on the street. \"The child still needs to go to school, you still need to prepare breakfast. You still need to try and be strong for that person. It eats away at your mindset, your mental health.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The LRU wants more protections for tenants in the capital\n",
      "\n",
      "The LRU says ending Section 21 is a \"big victory for tenants everywhere but soaring rents will continue to force many out of their homes and communities\". Jae Vail, a spokesperson for the union, said: \"Every person deserves a secure home where they can build a life without living in fear of eviction for challenging mistreatment or because their landlord seeks higher profits.\" However, he said tenants would \"not have real security without rent control\". \"Rent control would keep prices down and keep communities together,\" he said. \"Yet the government continues to side with the rich while ordinary people pay the price for our rigged housing system. It's time to put people's lives before landlords' portfolios.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'Level the playing field'\n",
      "\n",
      "A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said the Renters' Rights Bill remained on track to become law this year. They said it was a \"manifesto commitment and legislative priority\" for the Labour government, and the bill's \"transformational powers\" would be implemented swiftly after it becomes law. \"The bill will level the playing field by providing tenants with greater security, rights and protections in their homes, and including abolishing Section 21 evictions and rightly empowering tenants to directly challenge excessive rent hikes and poor conditions,\" the spokesperson added.\n",

      "Thousands of families are attempting to flee Gaza City as the Israeli military confirms it has begun ground operations that are part of its large-scale assault aimed at occupying the city. Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, told the BBC she had resisted leaving her home - despite the danger - until she received a phone call from an Israeli officer ordering her to evacuate. \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent,\" she said. \"It took us 10 hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels (£735) for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \"powerful operation\" had been launched in Gaza City, which he described as Hamas's last major stronghold. The Israeli military has designated al-Rashid coastal road as the only permitted route for civilians to use to evacuate. Many have described severe congestion, endless queues of cars and trucks, and long delays, with families stranded on the roadside while airstrikes continue overhead.

Residents said renting a small truck now costs around 3,000 shekels (£630), while a tent for five people sells for about 4,000 shekels (£840). With most families deprived of income since the war began, some are forced to walk for miles or remain in their homes despite the risks. Overnight into Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Gaza City, with concentrated bombardment on the central al-Daraj neighbourhood, the Beach refugee camp in the west, and Sheikh Radwan in the north. The attacks were accompanied by artillery fire, drone fire and helicopter gunship activity. The Israel Defense Forces said it was \"gradually\" moving into Gaza City as part of the \"next phase\" of its offensive. It said air and ground forces would be part of this next stage of the military's operation, with the number of troops increasing day-by-day. Residents described the overnight strikes as \"hell\". Ghazi al-Aloul, a displaced resident from northern Gaza, told the BBC he is now sleeping at the entrance of al-Quds Hospital in Tel al-Hawa, southwest Gaza. \"I did not choose this,\" he said. \"I was forced after leaving the home where my family and I had been sheltering for nearly a month after fleeing the north\". \"The bombardment has been insane for hours, and the army is threatening to demolish several residential buildings in the area.\"\n",

      "It's finally happening. After months of economic debate and mounting attacks from US President Donald Trump, the US central bank is poised to cut interest rates on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce it is lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points. That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25% - the lowest level since late 2022. The move - the bank's first rate cut since last December - is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they carry a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates. Nor are they likely to satisfy the president, who has called for far deeper cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways, it is no surprise that the Fed, which sets interest rate policy independent of the White House, is cutting. The inflation that ripped through the post-pandemic economy and prompted the bank to raise interest rates in 2022 has come down significantly. In the UK, Europe, Canada and elsewhere, central banks have already responded with lower rates, while the Fed's own policymakers have said for months that they expected to lower borrowing costs by at least half a percentage point this year. At the Fed's last meeting, two members of the board even backed a cut. They were outvoted, as other members remained worried that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, tariffs and mass detentions of migrant workers, might cause inflation to flare back up again. And it's true that the US in recent months has seen inflation tick higher. Prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to August, the fastest pace since January, and still above the Fed's 2% target. But in recent weeks, those concerns have been eclipsed by weakness in the labour market. The US reported meagre job gains in August and July and an outright loss in June - the first such decline since 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It really comes down to what we've seen in the jobs market - the deterioration that we've seen over the past few months,\" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, which is expecting rates to drop by 0.75 percentage points by the end of the year. \"The Fed knows that when the labour market turns, it turns very quickly, so they're wanting to make sure they're not stepping on the brakes of the economy at the same time the labour market has already slowed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Trump has rejected concerns about economic weakness, the rate cut should not be unwelcome to him - he has spent months blasting the Fed's hesitance to cut rates, which he says should be as low as 1%. On social media, he has called Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell \"a real dummy\", accusing him of holding back the economy by leaving interest rates too high for too long. \"Too Late\" MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND. HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!\" Trump wrote in a social media post this week, referring to Powell. Trump's pressure is not just rhetorical. He moved quickly to install the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, on the Fed in time for this week's meeting after a short-term vacancy opened up last month. His administration has also threatened Powell with firing and investigation and is locked in a legal battle over its effort to fire economist Lisa Cook, another member of the board.\n",

Foreign Office minister Seema Malhotra said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the case and that her thoughts were with the family. \"We know that methanol poisoning and counterfeit alcohol pose a serious, life-threatening risk to British travellers in some parts of the word. This is a deeply concerning issue and we are committed to helping keep people safe,\" she said. \"We are tackling this issue head-on, working with local authorities and over 150 travel industry partners to raise awareness of the dangers of methanol poisoning.\"\n",

      "EPA The South Korean workers, seen here boarding buses at Incheon airport, were repatriated last Friday\n",
      "\n",
      "When Youngjin looked out of his office window and saw armoured trucks and immigration enforcement officers running around with guns, he was surprised, but not worried. The young South Korean was certain it had nothing to do with him. He was in the US only for a few weeks on a short-term visa, he thought to himself. Then the armed agents burst into his room and ordered him outside. They handcuffed him, before attaching chains to his waist and ankles, and loaded him onto a bus bound for a detention centre. \"I panicked and my mind went blank. I felt sick,\" he told the BBC, now back home in South Korea. \"I couldn't understand why I was being treated like this.\" Youngjin is one of more than 300 Korean workers who were detained in the US state of Georgia earlier this month, in one of the largest immigration raids of Donald Trump's presidency to date. He and others interviewed for this article didn't want to reveal their real names in order to protect their identity.\n",

      "US officials initially claimed the workers had been in the country illegally on incorrect visas, but eventually the two sides struck a deal allowing them to leave voluntarily without any penalties, so they could return to work there in the future. Most of the workers were in the US temporarily, helping to build an electric car battery plant run by two South Korean companies, Hyundai and LG – part of a US push to get foreign companies to invest and manufacture more in the states. LG said that many of its employees who were arrested had various types of visas or were under a visa waiver programme. And so they were especially shocked by the raid. \"We just came out for a brief break and I could see a lot of people, officials with guns. As Koreans, we just thought they were here to arrest criminals, but then, they suddenly started arresting us,\" said Chul-yong, who was also detained that day. He said they tried to explain who they were, but they were terrified: \"There were helicopters and drones, armoured vehicles… people with guns.\" There were some officers pointing guns at workers, he claimed. \"You know those red lasers that come out of those guns? It was so shocking that some people were shivering in fear.\" Even those who managed to share their visa details said they were arrested. \"I thought everything would be cleared up but instead, they suddenly shackled us,\" said Mr Kim, another worker detained, who only wanted to reveal his last name. Chul-yong said there was a shackle around his ankles and another around his waist, connected to handcuffs. \"It was so tight, I couldn't touch my face with my hands.\" They all said they had no idea why this was happening, or where they were being taken. \"I later learned that I was detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center,\" added Chul-yong, a software engineer. He had been planning to stay for about a month but was arrested on his sixth day there.\n",

      "\n",
      "'It was freezing... the water smelt like sewage'\n",
      "\n",
      "Youngjin, an engineer and sub-contractor for LG, was scheduled to be there for five weeks to train staff to operate some of the specialist high-tech equipment. The 30-year-old was shaking, still visibly upset, as he described to the BBC being taken to the detention centre and locked in a room with 60-70 other people. \"I had a panic attack. I just stood there trembling,\" he said. The room was freezing, and the new detainees were not given blankets for the first two days, he added. \"I was wearing short sleeves, so I put my arms inside my clothes and wrapped myself in a towel to try to stay warm at night,\" he said. \"The worst part was the water. It smelt like sewage. We drank as little as possible.\" The bunk beds were all taken, Chul-yong said, by the time he arrived, leaving him and others to find any empty spot to rest, even an empty desk where they could put their head down. \"We tried to sleep anywhere, really. It was really cold. There were people who found packaged bread, heated it up in the microwave, hugging it throughout the night.\" For the first few days, Youngjin had no idea how long he would be held for. He feared it might be months. Only after some of the workers were able to meet lawyers and consular staff, did they realise their government was working with the US authorities to get them released. \"Even the US side feels it may have gone a bit too far,\" South Korea's chief trade negotiator told reporters after returning from the US. Seoul says it is now investigating potential human rights violations during the raid by US authorities. Trump acknowledged the need to have specialists from overseas train up US workers, and according to South Korean officials, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has expressed his \"deep regrets\" over the incident. Still, it has shaken relations between the US and South Korea, usually close allies, especially since it came hard on the heels of a trade deal in which South Korean companies pledged to invest $350bn in the US.\n",
